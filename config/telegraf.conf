  ## By default, telegraf will gather stats for all devices including

  ## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of

  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the

  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
